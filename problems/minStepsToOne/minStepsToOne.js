// Minimum Steps to One
// Given a positive integer, you can perform any combination of 3 operation for a interger:
// 1) Subtract 1 from it.
// 2) If its divisible by 2, divide by 2. 
// 3) If its divisible by 3, divide by 3.
// Find the minimum number of steps that it takes get from N to 1

// Input: Positive Integer N
// Output:Integer

// What is the time and space complexity for your solution? 
// Can you make it more efficient? 

const minStepsToOne = (num) => {
  // Your solution here
