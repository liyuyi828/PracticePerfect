# PracticePerfect
A collection of interesting coding problem to practice algorithim and data sturcture. 

Source of individual problems, if known, will be included in the prompt.

## Instruction on using this:
1. Fork an clone down repo to a local machine
2. Run `npm install` to install node.js test suite  
3. Uncomment desired tests on `mainTest.js`, then run `npm test`

If you think any test case were missing, please submit a pull request with additional test on the appropiate test file, I will merge it.

## Solution: 
I have list my solution for a particular problem on `Yuyi-solution` branch, with brief explaination. Those are my solutions for my first try of the problems, and definitely not the best. If you have any quesiton / comment / suggestion regarding the solution, please let me know.

Thank you. Happy Coding!
